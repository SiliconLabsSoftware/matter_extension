## Purpose/Scope

This application requires external SPI Flash of at least 1 MB. This sample configuration of the simplicity bootloader configures the bootloader to use an external SPI flash to store firmware update images. The storage configuration is set up to store a single firmware update image at a time, in a single storage slot. The storage slot is configured to start at address 0x0 of the SPI flash, and have a size of 1024 kB. This can be configured on the *"Bootloader Storage Slot Setup"*. This is the default bootloader configuration to use with Matter projects.

For information about multiple storage slot support, see the "SPI Flash Storage Bootloader (multiple images)" sample configuration.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### HW Requirements

For a full list of hardware requirements, see [Matter Hardware Requirements](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-overview/#hardware-requirements) documentation. This bootloader requires a board with external SPI flash of at least 1 MB.

### SW Requirements

For a full list of software requirements, see [Matter Software Requirements](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-overview/#software-requirements) documentation.

## Steps to Run Demo

1. Build the bootloader project for your target board, or use a pre-built binary.
2. Flash the bootloader to the device before flashing the application. Pre-built bootloader binaries for supported devices are available at [Matter Bootloader Binaries](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-prerequisites/matter-artifacts#matter-bootloader-binaries).
