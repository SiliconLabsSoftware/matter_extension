# Matter over Wi-Fi Closure Example

The Matter over Wi-Fi closure example is a baseline demonstration of a closure device built with Simplicity SDK. It can be controlled by a Matter controller over a Wi-Fi network.

## Purpose/Scope

This example demonstrates a sample implementation of a Matter over Wi-Fi closure
app running on a Silicon Labs SiWx917 SoC.

The device is commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), during which the Matter
controller and device exchange security credentials in the Rendez-vous procedure.
Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and PSK) are then provided so the device joins your Wi-Fi network and can be controlled by any Matter-compliant controller.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silicon Labs WSTK shows a QR code containing
the commissioning information for the BLE connection and Rendez-vous procedure.

This example serves as both a functional demonstration of Matter over Wi-Fi and a
starting point for building production products on the Silicon Labs platform.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### HW Requirements

For a full list of hardware requirements, see [Matter Hardware Requirements](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-overview/#hardware-requirements) documentation.

### SW Requirements

For a full list of software requirements, see [Matter Software Requirements](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-overview/#software-requirements) documentation.

## Steps to Run Demo

### Configuration and Setup

This sample app works out of the box with no additional configuration required. To customize the device, see the
[Custom Matter Device Development](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-references/custom-matter-device#custom-matter-device-development) guide.

**Region code (SiWx917 Wi-Fi):** For Wi-Fi configurations, the region code can be set in this [file](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/matter_sdk/blob/085bd03532990e5b1f99ff4b08ebce4f4ca5edf6/src/platform/silabs/wifi/SiWx/WifiInterface.cpp#L125). The available region codes can be found [here](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/f675628eefa1ac4990e94146abb75dd08b522571/components/device/silabs/si91x/wireless/inc/sl_si91x_types.h#L71).

### Sample Endpoint Configuration for Closure

### Steps for Execution

1. Build and flash the application to your board.
2. On startup, **LED 0** flashes short-on (50 ms on / 950 ms off), indicating the
   device is waiting for commissioning.
3. Commission the device using one of the following methods:

   **chip-tool (standalone or pre-built):** The pre-built chip-tool instance ships
   with the Matter Hub image. More information on using the Matter Hub is in the
   [Silicon Labs Matter Hub Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.8.0/matter-wifi/raspi-img).
   ```shell
   chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 <SSID> <PSK> 20202021 3840
   ```

   **Simplicity Connect mobile app:** Scan the QR code shown on the LCD or the URL
   printed to RTT logs on startup or by pressing BTN0. The URL can also be retrieved
   via the Matter shell:
   ```shell
   matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
   ```
   Example RTT log output:
   ```
   [SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
   [SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00
   ```
   This QR code is only valid for an unprovisioned device; provisioning may change it.

   **Other:** The device can also be provisioned and controlled using the Python controller, Android, or iOS app.

4. Control the device. For sample endpoint configuration, see [Closure Sample Endpoint](/slc/image/closure-sample-endpoint.png).

   **Closure control (chip-tool)** (after commissioning; use your node-id if different from 1):
   ```shell
   chip-tool closurecontrol read cluster-revision 1 1
   ```

**Button and LED reference:**

| Control | Action            | Result                                                          |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| BTN0    | Press and release | Start/restart BLE advertisement; print QR code URL to device logs |
| BTN0    | Hold 6 s          | Initiate factory reset (release within 6 s to cancel)           |
| LED 0   | Short flash on    | Unprovisioned, waiting for commissioning                        |
| LED 0   | Rapid even flash  | BLE connected, commissioning in progress                        |
| LED 0   | Short flash off   | Provisioned, no full service connectivity                        |
| LED 0   | Solid on          | Fully provisioned with service connectivity                     |

## Troubleshooting

**Device does not advertise over BLE**
- Press BTN0 to restart BLE advertisement.

**Commissioning fails**
- Ensure the Wi-Fi SSID and PSK are correct and the network is reachable.
- Factory reset the device (hold BTN0 for 6 s) and retry.

**LCD or LEDs not working**
- **LCD:** If the board supports an LCD but it is not enabled, install the _Display_
  component under _Silicon Labs Matter > Matter > Platform > Display_. For the QR code
  on the LCD, install the _QR Code_ component under _Silicon Labs Matter > Matter >
  Platform > QR Code_ (Display is installed automatically).
- **LEDs:** If the board supports LEDs but they are not enabled, install `led0` and
  `led1` instances of _Simple LED_ under _Platform > Driver > LED > Simple LED_, then
  install _WSTK LED Support_ under _Silicon Labs Matter > Matter > Platform > WSTK LED Support_.
