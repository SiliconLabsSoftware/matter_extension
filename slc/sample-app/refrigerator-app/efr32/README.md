# Matter Refrigerator Example for EFR32

The Refrigerator and Temperature Controlled example provides a
baseline demonstration of a Temperature Controlled Cabinet device,
built using Matter and the Silicon Labs Simplicity SDK. It supports
control by a Chip controller over a Thread or Wi-Fi network.

The Refrigerator device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
where the device and the Chip controller exchange security information using
the Rendez-vous procedure. For Thread, the Thread Network credentials are
provided to the Refrigerator device, enabling it to join the Thread network.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK displays a QR Code containing
the necessary commissioning information for the BLE connection to start the
Rendez-vous procedure. Once commissioned, the display shows a representation
of the refrigerator's temperature-controlled state.

For more general information on running matter applications and pre-requisites please look at online 
documentation for Matter available on docs.silabs.com. Follow Thread demo instructions depending on the example you are running.

## Lighting Example User Interface

**LCD** 

The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over BLE.

![QR Code](qr_code_img.png)

A URL can be found in the **RTT logs upon startup OR by pressing BTN0**

**The URL can also be printed by issuing the following matter shell command:**

```shell
matterCli> onboardingcodes ble qrcodeurl
```

Log output example:

```shell
[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
[SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A6FCJ142C00KA0648G00
```

Note: This QR Code is only valid for an unprovisioned device. Provisioning may change the QR Code.

**LED 0** 

Shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The following states are possible:

-   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ ; The device is in the unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning application to connect.

-   _Rapid Even Flashing_ ; (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through Bluetooth LE.

-   _Short Flash Off_ ; (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully
provisioned, but does not yet have full Thread network or service
connectivity.

-   _Solid On_ ; The device is fully provisioned and has full Thread
 network and service connectivity.

    
**Push Button 0**

-   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops. In addition, this button should also print the QR Code URL to the RTT logs.

-   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device.
 Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset
 procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is
 initiated.

## Enabling LCD and LEDs in a Project

If an LCD is supported by the board but not enabled in a project it can be enabled in Studio by installing the _Display_ component under _Silicon Labs Matter->Matter->Platform->Display_

To enable the QR Code install the _QR Code_ component under _Silicon Labs Matter->Matter->Platform->QR Code_. (All the dependencies including LCD are installed automatically, there is no need to explicitly install the _Display_ component in this case.)

If LEDs are supported by the board but not enabled in a project they can be enabled as follows:
-   Install instances (led0 and led1) of the _Simple LED_ component under _Platform->Driver->LED->Simple LED_
-   Install the WSTK LED Support component under _Silicon Labs Matter->Matter->Platform->WSTK LED Support_

## Provision and Control

You can provision and control the Matter device using the python controller, Chip tool standalone, Android, iOS app or the Matter Hub provided by Silicon Labs. More information on using the Matter Hub can be found in the online Matter documentation here: [Silicon Labs Matter Documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/matter/2.6.0/matter-thread/raspi-img)

The pre-built chip-tool instance ships with the Matter Hub image which is available from Silicon Labs here: [Silicon Labs Matter Hub](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/SilabsMatterPi_2.6.0-1.4-extension.zip)
    
More information on using the chip-tool directly can be found here: [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)


Here is an example with the CHIPTool:

```shell
chip-tool pairing ble-thread 1 hex:<operationalDataset> 20202021 3840

```
