# Centralized dependency versions consumed by generation / packaging scripts.
#
# GOAL: Allow the *same dependency name* to resolve to different versions
#       depending on whether the project is a Thread (EFR) or Wi‑Fi (SiWx917) build.
#
# FORMAT:
#   thread:  dependencies used when path heuristics detect an EFR/Thread project
#   wifi:    dependencies used when path heuristics detect a SiWx917 (Wi‑Fi) project
#   common:  dependencies merged into BOTH (overridden by group-specific values if duplicated)
#
# To assign different versions to the same dependency per platform, DO NOT place
# that key in 'common'. Instead list it separately under 'thread' and 'wifi'.
# Example (kept same version below; change one side when you actually need divergence):
#   thread:
#     bluetooth_le_host: 0.0.6
#   wifi:
#     bluetooth_le_host: 0.0.6   # could become 0.0.7 if Wi‑Fi requires newer BLE host
#
# The generation scripts merge like: merged = common + group (group overrides).
# If you later introduce a new group, extend the script logic accordingly.

common:
  # Put deps here ONLY if version is identical across platforms.
  # (Left empty intentionally for now to demonstrate per-platform override capability.)
